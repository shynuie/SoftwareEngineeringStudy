|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
-----
## I. Independent Programming Services
### Promoting Software Industry: two major projects
* SABRE, airline reservation system, $30 million;
* SAGE, air defense system (1949~1962) 700/1000 programmers in the US. $8 billion;
----
## II. Software Product
### 1964 Martin Goetz developed Flowchart Software -- Autoflow for RCA, but rejected..
* Sale to the customer of RCA & IBM;
* Develop and market software products not specifically designed for a particular hardware platform.
* MARK IV, a pre-runner for the database management system

### IBM unbundled software form hardware
----
## III. Enterprise Solutions
### Dietmar Hopp. IBM Germany
* Systems, Applications and Products (SAP) $3.3 billion (1997)
* Setting up shop in Walldorf, Germany;
* Marked by the emergence of enterprise solutions providers, for e.g.,  
Bann 1978. Netherlands. $ 680 million(1997)  
Oracle 1977. U.S.  
Larry Ellison
* ERP, $45 billion (1997)
----
## IV. Packaged Software for the Masses
### Software products for the masses. 1979
* VisiCalc, Spreadsheet program.
### August 1981: The deal of the century
* Bill Gates bought the first version of the OS from a small firm called Seattle Computer Products for $50,000 without telling them it was from IBM.
* The development of the IBM PC, 1981, initiated a 4th software era.
### PC-based mass-market software. Few additional services are required for installation.
* Microsoft reached revenues of $11.6 billion. Packaged Software Products, $57 billion (1997)
----
## V. Internet Software and Services
### Internet and value-added services period, 1994. W
* with Netscape's browser software for the internet.

# State-of-art in Software Engineering

* Organizations "go with what has worked in the past";
* Everyone is too busy getting product out the door to spend time in education or training or addressing these problems effectively;
* "Out of date" practices become institutionalized;
----
## Software Engineering Today?
### Few people know, or can integrate, best practices
* Unable to adopt and utilize proven methodologies in timely fashion;
* Although significant improvements have been made in specific areas, the rapidly evolving nature of the software industry has resulted in little overall improvement in the overall situation;
----
## Not Crisis, but a Chronic Problem
### The crisis persists
* After 35 years later, the software "crisis" is still with us;
* Major problems are still the same:
    * poor quality (correctness, usability, maintainability, etc...);
    * over budget;
    * delivered late, or not at all.
* It is not a crisis but a chronic problem
    * It becomes a persistent, chronic condition that software industry has to face with;
----
## What's wrong?
### Dose software engineering have no progress at all?
* Not quite true
* We have indeed seen a lot of improvements, e.g. high level programming, object-oriented technology, etc.
### But it does not achieve its promise, why?
* Why is it hard to make production of fault-free software, delivered on time and within budget, that satisfies the users' needs, and is easy to maintain, etc?
* The comparison of 1995 and 2003's report does show that there is some progress in the past eight years.
----
## So, What's the problem?
* Software issues: software industry has changes a lot in the past years;
* Education issue: more emphasis on methods and tools but lack of sufficient education and training on people;
* Process and quality issue: there lacks of a set of known proven practices for software engineers to follow with;
----
## Today's Software
### Changes in software over time
* codes grew in size from 10's ~ 100's lines to 1,000's ~ 1,000,000's;
* operation environment changes from simple "batch" operations to complex multiprogramming systems, to time-sharing and distributed computing to today's Internet network computing environment;
### Different operation environments
* batch
    all works are done in one progress/thread by one device;
* multiprogramming  
    all works are done in multi threads by one device;
* time-sharing and distributed computing  
    * time-sharing: works are done for multi users in a short period by one device(asynchronous but users feel like synchronous);
    * distributed computing: works are done by multi devices/systems. Systems/Devices will communicate to each others;
* Internet network computing environment 
    works are done by remote devices, usually server, the local device usually only take input and display output.
### Software Changes in the Past Years
* As computer systems (both hardware and software) have become larger and more complex, the software development process has also become more and more complex;
* the simple art of "programming in the small" is no longer capable of coping with the task.
### Situations for Software are Different Too
* Driven by intense market forces, including persistent pressure to deliver software on unrealistic time schedules
    * Rapidly changing requirements;
    * Pressures for faster time to market;
* Continuing rapid evolution of software methodologies and systems
    * Integration of new processes and techniques;
    * Need to re-design major systems.
* Talent shortage: needed software engineering skills often in short supply;
* What even worse:
    * Moore's law means always trying new things;
    * Complexity moves into software;
    * Can't find the limits except by trial and error;

## The Software Industry Today

* Component-Base Engineering and Integration;
* Technological Heterogeneity;
* Enterprise Heterogeneity;
* Greater potential for Dynamic Evolution;
* Internet-Scale Deployment;
* Many competing standards;
* Many conflicting terminology.
----
    Remark: Heterogeneity is a composition of a software system which is made up of different languages and running on different systems by using different standard for communication.
----

## Three key Challenges

* Legacy systems
    * Old, valuable systems must be maintained and updated
* Heterogeneity
    * Systems are distributed and include a mix of hardware and software
* Delivery
    * There is increasing pressure for faster delivery of software

----

## Ever-Present Difficulties

* Few guiding scientific principles
* Few universally applicable methods
* As much
    * managerial
    * psychological
    * sociological as technological
