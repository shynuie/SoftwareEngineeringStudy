# Definition of Software engineering

## What is Software
* Software is a set of items or objects that form a `configuration` that includes
    * programs
    * documents
    * data
    * ...
* Think aother way:
    * Software consists of
        1. `instructions` (computer programs) that when executed provided desired function and performance;
        2. `data structures` that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information;
        3. `documents` that describe the operation and use of the programs.
* Above are only the concrete part of software that may be seen, there exists also `invisible part` which is more important:
    * Software is the `dynamic behavior` of programs on real computers and auxiliary equipment.
* a software product is a `model` of the real world, and the real world is `constantly changing`.
* Software is a `digital form of knowledge`.

## Unique Characteristics of Software
* Software is `malleable`;
* Software construction is `human-intensive`;
* Software is `intangible` and `hard to measure`;
* Software problems are usually `complex`;
* Software directly depends upon the `hardware`;
    * It is at the top of the system engineering "food chain".
* Software does `not wear out` but will `deteriorate`;
* Software solutions require `unusual rigor`;
* Software has `discontinuous operational nature`;
    * i.e., most functions in a software are not called when the software is running;

## Casting the Term (Boring history)
* The field of software engineering was born in `NATO Conference`, `1968`. (Maybe with these learning contents :smiley: )

----
## What is Software Engineering
* Different focuses for this term exist in various textbooks.
* The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to development, operation, and maintenance of software, i.e., the application of engineering to software - by IEEE 610.12, 1990.
* Z...Z...Z...

## So, Software Engineering is...
* Scope
    * study of software `process`, `development principles`, `techniques` and `notations`.
* Goals
    * production of quality software;
    * delivered `on time`;
    * `within budget`;
    * satisfying `customer's requirement` and `users' needs`.

## Software Process
* Waterfall life cycle
* Prototyping
* Spiral model
* Automatic synthesis model
    * Object-oriented model
    * 4 GL model

## Traditional Software Engineering
* Software Systems
    * Function | Data Flow Diagram
    * Data | Entity-Relation Diagram
    * Behavior | State Transition
----
## Object-Oriented Software Engineering
* Software Systems
    * Object | Class Diagram
    * Function | Data Flow Diagram
    * Behavior | State Chart
