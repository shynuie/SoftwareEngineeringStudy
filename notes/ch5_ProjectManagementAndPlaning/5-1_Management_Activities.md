# CH5-1 Management Activities

* Project management is needed because software development is always subject to `budget and schedule constraints` that are set by the organization developing the software.

* Recall the distinctions of software engineering:
    * The product is `intangible`
    * The product is uniquely `flexible`
    * Software engineering is `not recognized as an engineering discipline` with same status as mechanical, electrical engineering, etc.
    * The development process is not `standardized`.
    * Many software projects are `one-off project`

* Management Activities
    * Proposal writing
    * Project planning and scheduling
    * Project costing
    * Project monitoring and reviews
    * Personnel selection and evaluation
    * Report writing and presentations

* Management commonalities
    * Many techniques of engineering project management are `equally applicable` to software project management
    * Technically complex engineering systems tend to suffer from the same problems as software systems.

* Project staffing
    * May not be possible to appoint the `ideal people` to work on a project
        * Project budget may not allow for the user of highly-paid staff
        * Staff with the appropriate experience may not be available
        * An organization may wish to develop employee skills on a software project
    * Managers have to work within these constraints especially when three are shortage of trained staff
